```bml
{#bellows: (a bellows), (an accordion)}
{
    (Are not Heaven and Earth like {@bellows}?),
    (Yet Heaven and Earth and all that lies between are like {@bellows}.),
    (Yet is not the space between Heaven and Earth like {@bellows}?),
    (But isn't the space between Heaven and Earth like {@bellows}?)
}
Empty yet structured,
{@bellows:
    0 -> ({
        (worked, yet still the wind blows),
        (it moves, inexhaustibly giving)
    }),
    1 -> ({
        (pushed and pulled, inexhaustibly singing),
        (it moves, inexhaustibly singing),
        (worked, yet singing without end)
    })
}.
